  3) Additional meta fields: =shortauthor= , =sortkey=, =owner=  (= langsci) , =lastchange= (of the format =2015-11-18 15:17:28=)
  4) Entry keys are made up by referring up to the first two =author= names and the last two digits of =year= in the following way: =Name:12= or =Name1:Name2:12= or =Name:etal:12=.
      As for edited volumes, =editor= names are used and the infix =ed= is added: =Name:ed:12= or =Name1:Name2:ed:12= or =Name:etal:ed:12=

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Exceptions apply when, for certain proceedings (e.g. ACL proceedings), it is extremely unusual to provide editor names.
