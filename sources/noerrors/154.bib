	abstract="{\enspace}In this study, downward-directed mechanical perturbations were applied to the lower lip during both repetitive (/{\ldots}p{\ae}p{\ae}p{\ae}{\ldots}/) and discrete (/p 's{\ae}p{\ae}pl/) utterances in order to examine the perturbation-induced changes of intergestural timing between syllables (i.e., between the bilabial and laryngeal gestures for successive /p/'s) and within phonemes (i.e., between the bilabial and laryngeal gestures within single /p/'s ). Our findings led us to several conclusions. First, steady-state (phase-resetting) analyses of the repetitive utterances indicated both that ''permanent'' phase shifts existed for both the lips and the larynx after the system returned to its pre-perturbation rhythm and that smaller steady-state shifts occurred in the relative phasing of these gestures. These results support the hypothesis that central intergestural dynamics can be reset by peripheral articulatory events. Such resetting was strongest when the perturbation was delivered within a ''sensitive phase'' of the cycle, during which the downwardly directed lower-lip perturbation opposed the just-initiated, actively controlled bilabial closing gesture for /p/. Although changes in syllable duration were found for other perturbed phases, these changes were simply transient effects and did not indicate a resetting of the central ''clock.'' Second, analyses of the transient portions of the perturbed cycles of the repetitive utterances indicated that the perturbation-induced steady-state phase shifts are almost totally attributable to changes occurring during the first two perturbed cycles. Finally, the transient changes in speech timing induced by perturbations in the discrete sequences appeared to share a common dynamical basis with the changes to the repetitive sequences. We conclude by speculating on the type of dynamical system that could generate these temporal patterns.",

	abstract = {This study systematically investigates the temporal organization of American English onset and coda consonant clusters on the basis of kinematic data. Results from seven speakers suggest that consonants in complex onsets are organized globally with respect to the following vowel, while consonants in complex codas are organized locally relative to the preceding vowel. These results support the competitive coupling model hypothesized for complex onsets, a model according to which consonant gestures in onsets are each coupled in-phase to the vowel, and antiphase with each other. The results are overall also consistent with the noncompetitive coupling relations assumed for codas, by which only the first consonant in a cluster is coupled antiphase with the vowel, and any subsequent consonants are coupled antiphase to each other. However, our data also show that the segmental composition of the cluster affects the timing relationship in codas, particularly /lC/ coda clusters pattern differently from other clusters and do not adhere to the predicted timing relations. The data contribute to our understanding of the interaction of linguistic structure and motor control of the articulators in speech production.}

	abstract = {The departure point of the present paper is our effort to characterize and understand the spatiotemporal structure of articulatory patterns in speech. To do so, we removed segmental variation as much as possible while retaining the spoken act’s stress and prosodic structure. Subjects produced two sentences from the ‘‘rainbow passage’’ using reiterant speech in which normal syllables were replaced by /ba/ or /ma/. This task was performed at two self‐selected rates, conversational and fast. Infrared LEDs were placed on the jaw and lips and monitored using a modified SELSPOT optical tracking system. As expected, when pauses marking major syntactic boundaries were removed, a high degree of rhythmicity within rate was observed, characterized by well‐defined periodicities and small coefficients of variation. When articulatory gestures were examined geometrically on the phase plane, the trajectories revealed a scaling relation between a gesture’s peak velocity and displacement. Further quantitative analysis of articulator movement as a function of stress and speaking rate was indicative of a language‐modulated dynamical system with linear stiffness and equilibrium (or rest) position as key control parameters. Preliminary modeling was consonant with this dynamical perspective which, importantly, does not require that time per se be a controlled variable.}

	abstract = {Two experiments, in which the authors served as Ss, investigated the control of individual speech gestures by examining laryngeal and tongue movements during vowel and consonant production. A number of linguistic manipulations known to alter the durational characteristics of speech (speech rate, lexical stress, and phonemic identity) were tested. In all cases, a consistent pattern was observed in the kinematics of the laryngeal and tongue gestures. The ratio of maximum instantaneous velocity to movement amplitude, a kinematic index of mass-normalized stiffness, increased systematically as movement duration decreased. Specifically, the ratio of maximum velocity to movement amplitude varied as a function of a parameter serving as an index of velocity profile shape times the reciprocal of movement duration. The conformity of the data to this relation indicates that durational change was accomplished by scalar adjustment of a base velocity form. Findings are consistent with the idea that kinematic change is produced by the specification of articulator stiffness.}

However, the longstanding notion that essential tremor is a monosymptomatic tremor disorder is being challenged by a growing literature describing associated disturbances of tandem walking, personality, mood, hearing, and cognition. There is also epidemiologic, pathologic, and genetic evidence that essential tremor is pathophysiologically heterogeneous. Misdiagnosis of essential tremor is common because clinicians frequently overlook other neurologic signs and because action tremor in the hands is caused by many conditions, including dystonia, Parkinson disease, and drug-induced tremor. Thus, essential tremor is nothing more than a syndrome of idiopathic tremulousness, and the challenge for researchers and clinicians is to find specific etiologies of this syndrome.",

	abstract = {SUMMARY The pathophysiology of essential tremor (ET) remains unknown. Standard neuropathological studies have reported no consistent changes but a detailed study found neurodegeneration in all ET cases – 24\% demonstrated lower brainstem Lewy body (LB) inclusions and 76\% experienced a loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and its sequelae. We review the evidence on neurodegeneration in ET. The prevalence of LB inclusions in ET brains is similar to that in the asymptomatic general population. These incidental LB disease cases have evidence for reduced striatal tyrosine hydroxylase levels, as found in Parkinson’s disease, but there is no evidence for reduced tyrosine hydroxylase levels in ET patients. Reduced mean PC counts in ET cases compared with the controls reported by some studies could not be replicated by others. Most ET cases have the same number of PCs as controls of a comparable age. Neither the lower brainstem LB inclusions nor the cerebellar PC loss represent the neurodegenerative basis of ET. Further studies are needed to determine the pathophysiology of ET.}

As a measure of rate of speech the duration of opening-closing movements during articulation was determined from speech wave variables. The intensity of sound emission during articulatory closure as required for stop consonant production, for example, magnitude of p, magnitude of t, magnitude of k, was used as an index of the degree of closure. Speech tempo was not significantly different from normal. The patients, however, had a reduced capacity of completing articulatory occlusion. This was interpreted as reflecting a reduction in movement amplitude of the articulators. Articulatory "undershoot" was not uniform but influenced by linguistic demands in that the closures associated with a stressed syllable were performed at the expense of unstressed ones. Furthermore, switching between opening and closing movements of the articulators in sentence production seemed undisturbed. These results indicate that motor planning of speech differs from arm movement control.},

	abstract="The pathogenesis of essential tremor (ET) is still under debate. Several lines of evidence indicate that ET is associated with cerebellar dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to find corroborating evidence for this claim by investigating balance and speech impairments in patients with ET. In addition, the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on balance and speech function was studied. A group of 25 ET patients including 18 with postural and/or simple kinetic tremor (ETpt) and seven ET patients with additional clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction (ETc) was compared to 25 healthy controls. In addition, 12 ET patients with thalamic DBS participated in the study. Balance control was assessed during gait and stance including tandem gait performed on a treadmill as well as static and dynamic posturography. Motor speech control was analyzed through syllable repetition tasks. Signs of balance impairment were found in early stages and advanced stages of ET. During locomotion, ET patients exhibited an increased number of missteps and shortened stride length with tandem gait. ETc patients and, to a lesser extent, ETpt patients had increased postural instability in dynamic posturography conditions that are sensitive to vestibular or vestibulocerebellar dysfunction. ETc but not ETpt patients exhibited significantly increased syllable durations. DBS had no discernable effect on speech performance or balance control. We conclude that the deficits in balance as well as the subclinical signs of dysarthria in a subset of patients confirm and extend previous findings that ET is associated with an impairment of the cerebellum.",

	abstract = { Fricative spectral data are compared with articulatory data from electropalatographic (EPG) recordings in an investigation of coarticulatory effects on the acoustic signal. Data were taken from CV tokens produced by four female speakers of Australian English. Results are presented for the coronal fricatives /θ s ∫ ð z 3/in seven monophthong vowel contexts. The analysis consists of a comparison of spectral centre of gravity (COG) with EPG centre of gravity measured along the horizontal dimension. The correlation between the articulatory and the acoustic datais quitehigh. Overall, the sibilant fricatives show very little variability in production, while the nonsibilant dental shows a good deal of variability. This is reflected in the spectral output. It is also shown that the alveolar sibilants show more effectfrom vowel context than do the postalveolar sibilants. These results are interpreted as showing that coarticulatory resistance is indeed greater for sibilant fricatives, but that degree of tongue body raising inherent in the fricative's production must also be taken into account. The results for overall variability are discussed with reference to the Hyper- and Hypo- and Quantal Theories of speech production.It is suggested that sibilant fricatives do not lend themselves to the articulatory imprecision which, according to these theories, characterizes perceptually salient, and typologically common, speech sounds.}

	abstract = {This article takes stock of the basic notions of Information Structure (IS). It first provides a general characterization of IS—following Chafe (1976)—within a communicative model of Common Ground (CG), which distinguishes between CG content and CG management. IS is concerned with those features of language that affect the local CG. Second, this paper defines and discusses the notions of Focus (as indicating alternatives) and its various uses, Givenness (as indicating that a denotation is already present in the CG), and Topic (as specifying what a statement is about). It also proposes a new notion, Delimitation, which comprises contrastive topics and frame setters, and indicates that the current conversational move does not entirely satisfy the local communicative needs. It also points out that rhetorical structuring partly belongs to IS.}

An insightful analysis of the appropriate generalizations can be accommodated under a 'modular' approach to grammatical theory. Certain observations concerning the stress properties of WH questions are shown to be consistent with the assumptions of trace theory as developed in, e.g., Chomsky & Lasnik 1977, where the relationship between focus and stress is mediated by S-structure. The notion of focus has no consistent pragmatic characterization; it is, rather, a grammatical notion. The interpretation of this grammatical notion in particular discourse contexts is provided by rules of Discourse Grammar using the predicate 'c-construable', which is here defined.},

	abstract = {This paper examines predictions made by two theories of the relationship between pitch accent and focus. The empirical evidence presented suggests that listeners are sensitive to a variety of factors that may affect the focus projection ability of pitch accents, that is the ability of a pitch accent on one word to mark focus on a larger constituent. The findings suggest that listeners' interpretation of focus structure is most sensitive to the presence or absence of a pitch accent on a focused constituent and the deaccenting of following unfocused material (pitch accent position). Preliminary evidence su ggests that the status of a pitch accent as nuclear or prenuclear may also affect listeners' interpretations, though to a lesser extent than accent position. Finally, the results show that focus projection is affected only minimally, if at all, by the type of pitch accent (at least for the two accent types compared (H * vs. L + H *)).}

	abstract = {Acoustical analyses of speech production were conducted to determine the effects of two types of sentence focus distinction on intonational attributes of fundamental voice frequency (Fo) and duration. In each of two experiments, analyses were performed on seven speakers who orally read sentences containing variations in focus prompted by preceding questions. In Experiment 1, speakers produced higher Fo peaks and longer word durations for words assigned narrow focus in comparison with the same words in neutral-focus sentences. Sentences bearing broad focus on the verb phrase, however, were produced with a widespread durational increase but no heightening of Fo peaks. In Experiment 2, speakers produced comparable Fo peaks and word durations for narrow-focused words regardless of whether the sentence contained one or two foci. The main difference between the single and dual focus sentences was that the word following an initial focused item in a dual-focus sentence did not exhibit the low Fo value characteristic of words that follow focused items. The lack of a low post-focus Fo in dual-focus sentences represents an anticipatory influence of the additional focus at the end of the sentence.}

	abstract = {A series of experiments was carried out to investigate the syllable affiliation of intervocalic consonants following short vowels, long vowels, and schwa in Dutch. Special interest was paid to words such as letter [l∊[UNKNOWN]t] “id.,” where a short vowel is followed by a single consonant. On phonological grounds one may predict that the first syllable should always be closed, but earlier psycholinguistic research had shown that speakers tend to leave these syllables open. In our experiments, bisyllabic word forms were presented aurally, and participants produced their syllables in reversed order (Experiments 1 through 5), or repeated the words inserting a pause between the syllables (Experiment 6). The results showed that participants generally closed syllables with a short vowel. However, in a significant number of the cases they produced open short vowel syllables. Syllables containing schwa, like syllables with a long vowel, were hardly ever closed. Word stress, the phonetic quality of the vowel in the first syllable, and the experimental context influenced syllabification. Taken together, the experiments show that native speakers syllabify bisyllabic Dutch nouns in accordance with a small set of prosodic output constraints. To account for the variability of the results, we propose that these constraints differ in their probabilities of being applied.}
