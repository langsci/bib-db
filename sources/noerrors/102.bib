Asher, N. and A. Lascarides [1998] Bridging, Journal of Semantics, 15(1), pp83-113, Oxford University Press.

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a novel analysis of bridging, paying particular attention to definite descriptions. We argue that extant theories don't do justice to the way different knowledge resources interact. In line with Hobbs (1979), we claim that the rhetorical connections between the propositions introduced in the text plays an important part. But our work is distinct from his in that we model how this source of information interacts with compositional and lexical semantics. We formalise bridging in a framework known as SDRT (Asher, 1993). We demonstrate that this provides a richer, more accurate interpretation of definite descriptions than has been offered so far.

Built upon the foundation principles of the Linguistic Annotation Framework, the model (RAF, Reference Annotation Framework) is based on the combination of a simple meta-model (expressing markables and links between them) and a selection of data categories representing the information actually attached to each component of the meta-model. Based on the observation of existing practices we show how this model can be used in a variety of practical and theoretical configurations.},

The experiments show that annotators do converge on the identity of these text regions, though much of what they do can be captured by a simple model. Demonstrative pronouns are more likely than definite descriptions to be marked with discourse antecedents. We suggest that our methodology is suitable for the systematic study of discourse deixis.},
