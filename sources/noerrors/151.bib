 abstract = {Two types of bound morphemes-clitics and inflectional affixes-are found attached to (free) words in many languages. At least six lines of evidence separate the clear cases on each side: the degree of selection between the dependent morpheme and the word to which it is attached; arbitrary lexical gaps; phonological idiosyncrasies; semantic idiosyncrasies; syntactic operations affecting the combinations; and restrictions on the combinability of clitics with inflectional affixes. These criteria all indicate that {English} contracted auxiliaries (She's gone) are clitics, but that the {English} contracted negative (She hasn't gone) is an inflectional affix-a rather surprising conclusion that turns out to have satisfying consequences.},

They develop a unified analysis for these phenomena, claiming that they all involve a process of weakening within prosodic domains. While we agree with their important insight that the PF interface is responsible for some of these phenomena, we will argue against their weakening analysis. We provide arguments that agreement asymmetries cannot be uniformly analyzed as involving the same processes as phonological cliticization or null subjects. We instead propose that the observed asymmetries arise because of the alternative forms of spelling out features at the PF interface.},

     abstract = {The paper focuses on resumption in Greek relative clauses. It is argued that resumption arises on two occasions: (i) as a last resort strategy when identification of ?-features of non-arguments fails; (ii) in the absence of a syntactic feature on C trigerring AGREE/MOVE. In the first case obligatory resumption is restricted to non-argument positions and is sensitive to islands. This is the case of Greek null operator restrictive relatives. In particular, it is argued that identification requirements are grammaticised on Greek C (pu), which is endowed with ?-features. Failure of AGREE of the ?-features of pu leads to resumption in non-argument positions. In questions and operator restrictive relatives identification requirements are straightforwardly satisfied by the presence of an overt operator; resumption therefore is never obligatory in these structures. In the second case, where resumption is the consequence of absence of a syntactic relation (AGREE/MOVE) between C and the relativised site, resumption is obligatory in argument and non-argument positions (modulo the highest subject restriction) and insensitive to islands. Greek non-restrictive relatives and Semitic restrictive relatives exemplify this case.},

More specifically, it deals with alternative realizations of syntactic terminals that occur when a particular phrase immediately follows a particular head. We argue that this type of allomorphy is not conditioned by a syntactic adjacency condition. Instead, it is found when the head and phrase in question are contained in the same prosodic phrase at the interface that connects syntax and phonology (PF). We illustrate our approach with six case studies, concerning agreement weakening in Dutch and Arabic, pronoun weakening in Middle Dutch and Celtic, and pro-drop in Old {French} and Arabic.},

I adopt the derivation-and-evaluation model of grammar, according to which Chomsky's computational system ( ${\rm C}_{{\rm HL}}$ ) functions as a generator which produces candidates that are evaluated in an optimality theoretic manner, and it is shown that the strong/weak distinction can be captured by assuming an interaction between a constraint that disfavors movement (STAY) and a constraint (family) F that requires checking of the formal features. The discussion of Scandinavian Object Shift shows that this is not just a reformulation of the original distinction, but has various desirable empirical consequences. The article concludes with a discussion of Scrambling of the Dutch/German type.},

   Volume = {104},
   Pages = {13--29},
   Note = {It is assumed that all members of a candidate set are projected from the same numeration, and target the same semantic representation.  Passive morphology assumed to be preattached to V, so that it counts in the numeration. Active and passive candidates thus never compete with one another, and the non-existence of passive cannot follow from a competing active. However the null PARSE does compete. The absence of passive is always attributed to the fact that the null candidate wins in the competition. 

Posits three constraints to account for languages with the following array of passives:

Constraints:  EPP, Parse Passive, Stay

EPP taken to be trigger for passive, rather than Case (this is compatible with pseudo-passives). EPP is interpreted as a thematic rather than structural constraint, i.e. as the requirement that the {VP} be interpreted as a predicate, therefore with an open position. Intransitive passives lack this open position. Expletive do not satisfy this requirement unless they have an associate (which raises at LF and leaves an open position). In lgs with an expletive in impersonal passives, the expletive is not there to satisfy the EPP (since there is no associate).

STAY: enforces locality of movement in passives. A violation is incurred by every node which separates a trace from its antecedent. Depending on where it is ranked, it can suppress movement entirely.

Parse (passive): the only candidate in the candidate set which violates this is the null parse. High-ranking Parse (passive) will force a passive output, even if it violates EPP and STAY. However, failure of a higher ranked constraint to be satisfied (EPP, Stay) will result in null parse, meaning that meaning will be approximated by some other construction.

a. no passive to either tv or iv
               Stay, EPP >>  Parse Passive
b. impersonal passives to both tv and iv (and no personal passive)
               Parse Passive, Stay >> EPP
c. impersonal passive for iv and personal passive for tv
               Parse Passive >> EPP >> Stay
d. no passive to iv; personal passive to tv
               EPP >> Parse Passive >> Stay

Unclear to me why the ranking in [d] excludes insertion of an expletive in intransitive cases -- bec. EPP is only satisfied when the {VP} is actually predicated of something.},

In this case, A and M see Dowty's principle working in a  'syntagmatic' fashion. Their goal is to account for alternations in causee coding which are linked to semantic differences having to do with degree of control (e.g. direct vs. indirect causation). They propose that the ASP can also operate in a paradigmatic fashion: if a lg makes available multiple encodings for the causee (i.e. this is given), then they will be associated with degree of control in a principled fashion. Here all that is at issue is the causee coding, without reference to coding of higher agent or the lower theme. These two selection principles can conflict and how they are resolved is a source of lg-particular difference in causee encoding.},

   Journal = {Natural Language \& Linguistic Theory},
   Volume = {16},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {633--678},
   Note = {A theory which seeks to link VSO order with null subject pronouns. The EPP is universal, The EPP involves checking a +D feature on a non-nominal head (e.g. I or AGR). and is universal.  But it is parametrized and satisfiable in two ways: by XP movement or insertion ("merger"), or by Head movement. Lgs. like {English} satisfy it in the first way (either by inserting an expletive or moving the subject). Lgs. like {S}panish and Greek satisfy it in the second way, by raising V. V in these lgs. has a +D feature which permits it to check the +D feature in I (see paper for details of implementation). In these languages, preverbal "subject" position is an A' position (not in the same maximal projection as the finite verb), and they associate it with a CLLD construction (the element in that position is base-generated and binds a pronominal):a. the "subject" can be separated from V by adverbs (this assumes that adverbs do not attach to X', and requires an account of {English} cases like John probably as left)b. it is restricted to elements with wide scope (this follows if narrow scope is associated with VP-internal position and is preserved under movement; but there is no movement in these cases; c) in these lgs. an overt pronoun interpreted as bound variable cannot occur preverbally. This is interpreted as the consequence of a constraint which allows a pronoun in an A position (but not an Abar position) to be interpreted as a bound variable. The presence of DR effects (definiteness restriction) in existential contexts is a semantic effect (Keenan); the presence of DR effects in other contexts is a syntactic effect, tracable to the presence of an overt or covert expletive in subject position. Hence, the absence of a DR in VSO order points to there being no expletive.  There is a "core parameter" having to do with the presence of pronominal features in the verbal morphology. In lgs with this feature,  (e.g. Greek, {S}panish) verbal agreement morphology has the same status as pronouns in lgs. like {English}. "By hypothesis, EPP-checking is D-feature checking in a non-substantive category by a [nominal] lexical category" (p. 517) The parameter (p. 518) is conceived of as whether the EPP is checked by Move/Merge XP or by Move/Merge X.  This means that AGR is universally strong, and therefore universally present, in the terms of Chomsky 1995. A further independent parameter concerns the presence of [Spec, TP], a subject position outside {VP} but below the position for EPP checking. Lgs which make use of this position do so for Case reasons, and it is found in transitive expletive constructions (Icelandic) and is related to object shift (see Bobaljik and Jonas).},

They assume that A-movement is motivated by the need to check an EPP feature or Case feature. Since Raising proceeds from a clause with full agreement, they conclude that this agreement does not check Case. The need for Case drives Raising. The propose that Agreement is a PF reflex of formal feature checking either Case or EPP. They propose there are at least two types of Agreement-Case, Agreement-EPP relations: 1) Agreement is a reflex of N/Case-checking ({english}, portuguese); (ii) Agreement is the reflex of EPP checking (Greek, other Balkan languages). They argue further that Agreement is disassociated from Case when T lacks semantic tense. Their final proposal is that Agr is linked to EPP, while Tense is linked to Case. (So in embedded clause, there is agreement, which is associated with the EPP, but not with case assignment.) The tensed verb in the main clause is linked to Case.},

   Note = {Argue that ergatives are assigned Case in situ from little v. Arguing against the hypothesis that ergatives are assigned Case by T and as such 'ergative is a structural case, differing from the nominative only in terms of morphology and whether intransitive subjects align with it.' (p. 3). Look at behavior of Nominative and ERgative A's in Hindi, a language which marks A's differently depending on tense. Summary of arguments for seeing Ergative as inherent case, assigned in theta position (can occur in non-finite clauses (Legate 2005) on Walpiri; occurs closer to root (than what? absolutive?); ergative marking on unergatives like 'scream' varies according to agency (Mohanan 1994?) (did Woolford make same point?); "optionality of ergative in lgs like Nez Perce, Hindi suggests that the ergative cannot be characterized as a structural case licensed only afterthe obligatory discharge of v case" (p. 4). 

Their account of case licensing in perfect clauses closely parallels what I am proposing for AF in {T}z'utujil, Q'anjob'al: the perfect involves a participle which lacks the capacity to assign Accusative (being derived historically from a passive). To get both args licensed, v assigns inherent Case to the A argument, and then T is available to assign Nom to the O argument. Per this article, you need to get the external argument out of the c-command domain of T before T can enter into an Agree relation with O. [Is this relevant to the extraction of the external argument required in this construction? "As traces are invisible to the minimal link condition, the effect of moving the subject out of the c-command domain of T is an instance of derivational punting of an inactive goal out of the way of an AGREE relation between T and the object DP" (p. 16). (Is this just A traces, or also A'bar traces??]

NB: Hindi clauses with Ergative A and Accusative O (-ko) are problematic under this analysis, since the participle which enables ergative on A should not enable Accusative on O. They resolve this by introducing another Head to license Accusative. => they use 'inherent' case in two different ways in this paper: to refer to ergative which seems to be checked when the DP emerges from the lexicon, and to refer to the -ko Accusative, which is checked by Enc (p. 20).

Their use of 'differential case' is also odd -- they say that 'ergative' case on A is just 'differential', but seems to reflect a difference in way abstract Case is licensed.  

The empirical material their paper deals with is inverse scope and the fact that Nom A's and Erg A's behave differently in capacity to take narrow scope wrt universal O argument. 

Some poet (NOM) writes every poem (ACC). E > A, A > E.
Some poet (Erg) wrote every poem (NOM). E > A; *A > E.

In their account, "every poem" QR's to a position above vP (they do not specify where); The A arg is SUBECT (in Spec, T) in both constructions on surface. The inverse scope reading A > E can arise in (1) because Nom can reconstruct to spec, V where it is c-commanded by the QR'd O argument. It can't arise in (2) because Erg can't reconstruct. The reason it can't is because it doesn't enter into an Agree relation with T, the position FROM WHICH it reconstructs. I can understand this in these terms: scope of quantificational elements is fixed in Abar positions, but not in A positions.},

It is claimed that Tagalog is best characterized as neither accusative nor ergative but rather as a language that is a hybrid of these two language types. Tagalog's hybrid nature is neatly captured structurally within Principle and Parameters theory using {VP} internal subjects. In terms of Case, Tagalog not only has nominative-absolutive Case checking and ergative Case checking but it also makes extensive use of inherent accusative Case assignment. As a result, Tagalog has both a [NOM ACC] basic transitive sentence type, like accusative languages, and a [ERG ABS] basic transitive sentence type, like ergative languages. A specific structural analysis is given for these basic sentences under an Economy approach. This analysis is extended to account for complex sentences including sentences involving morphological causatives, conjunction reduction and raising.},

   Note = {Identifies three problems for OT: representing optionality, representing ambiguity, expressing ineffability. Assumes Smolensky's bidirectional optimization for ineffability problem. Assumes Boersma's floating constraints, where one constraint does not  "deterministically outrank" another, but rather probabilistically. In any given evaluation, the ranking is fixed, but depending on the ranking difference between two constraints, the chances of one outranking the other varies according to formula. 

Data dealt with here concerns the linking between arguments and syntactic form in Marathi, and the fact that various predicates have alternate linkages. The problem then is how to express this optionality.

The basic generalizations are that volitional arguments prefer to be subjects. If one argument is volitional, it will be subj; if both are volitional, then other constraints come into play. If neither is volitional, then either can be subject and the other will be object. This is achieved by a) decomposing the P-A and P-P roles into properties (a la Dowty) and by aligning grammatical function with P-property (below, P-P stands for Proto-Patient properties)

*Su/P-P >> *Su/P-A(-vol) >> *Su/P-A(vol)
*NonSu/P-A(vol) >> *NonSu/P-A(-vol) >> *NonSu/P-P

Marathi ranking:

*NonSu/P-A(vol) >> 
{(i) *Su/P-P, (ii) *Su/P-A(-vol), (iii) *NonSu/P-A(-vol), (iv) *NonSu/P-P} 
*Su/P-A(vol)

(middle 4 constraints are "floating", same ranking value. However, the ranking of i and ii is fixed (as shown) by harmonic alignment; ditto for iii and iv. This limits the number of possible rankings to 6.)

There are three situations with no volitional argument:

a. two args have same number of P-A and P-P properties;
b. two args have same number of P-A or P-P properties, but one has more P-A or more P-P properties than other;
c. one arg has more P-A properties and the other has more P-P properties.

a: no preference in which is Su and which is Oj
b. preference for arg. with greater number of P-A properties to be Su (etc.)
c. no choice -- arg. for more P-A properties is subject; argument with more P-P properties is object.

Preference in (b) is expressed by the number of rankings in which one argument is chosen as subject vs. the number in which the other argument is chosen.},

(Interesting how this parallels multiple obviatives and multiple objects). Shows how possible onset clusters, word-internal syllabification can be predicted by ranking of other structural constraints among the markedness constraints characterizing onset clusters. Also uses a notion of DISTANCE among the members of an onset clusters (how far apart are they in sonority?) which might be useful in thinking about differential object marking.},

Besides their null pronoun argument, they can also license an argument in the role of possessor ('Possessor Ascension' is a superfluous notion). These conclusions emerge from a new morphosyntactic analysis, which also entails that the verb agrees with all and only final terms (multistratal reference is unnecessary). The paradigm gaps, constraints on incorporation, and limited conditions for optional passive, though seemingly intricate, all point to a single hierarchical principle. This hierarchy calls for a simple but previously unexplored formalism, a tiered model reminiscent of autosegmental phonology.},

Authors assume that in Chukchi, which has ergative case marking, but a nominative/accusative verb agreement system which is sensitive to transitivity, that little v cannot assign accusative case. Consequently, the internal argument raises up between the external argument and T. T assigns two cases, a marked one (ergative) to the higher argument and an unmarked one (absolutive) to the lower argument. The identity between the two types of absolutives comes from the fact that they are checked for case by the same head (T). (This is a case then of where something blocks internal assignment of Accusative Case, cf. Anand Nevins)

Their solution to 'spurious antipassive' -- which involves a mismatch between syntax (transitive) and morphology (intransitive verb) -- is morphology and involves deletion of the object feature from its high postion near T. This means it is not inflected on the verb, though the argument remains in situ (the lower copy is pronounced). NB, this is a language with both case and agreement -- the case marking is transitive in this construction, just the morphology is antipassive -- triggered here by constraints on person of S and O.},

   Note = {A revision of the paper "The Emergence of the Unmarked Pronoun II" presented at the Hopkins Optimality Theory Workshop/Maryland Mayfest 1997, Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland, May 9--12.

Characterizes pronoun in terms of referential role and functions, not phrase structure category. In terms of referential role, they are 'basic anaphoric expressions characterized by systematically shifting reference to persons within the utterance context". Gives operational definition of anaphoricity as 'referential dependence upon a superordinate pronoun within a sentence' 

Posits three crosslinguistic properties of personal pronouns:
PRO: shifting reference, anaphoricity
TOP: topic anaphoricity ("'TOP'  abbreviates informational structural functions of personal pronouns, such as specialization for reference to topical elements")
AGR: classificatory dimensions by which personal pronominals are morphologically distinguished.

(Not all pronouns have AGR and TOP features). 
Pronominal content can be represented by feature structures involving these features.
Pronominal inventory of lg can be defined as pairing of instances of structural types (e.g. zero-bound-clitic-weak-pronoun) with feature structures representing pronominal content. 

In OT terms, universal content of personal pronominals ('input') will consist of all possible feature structures involving the features above; and universal candidate set all possible pairings of these feature structures with form types. 

The structural types are classified along two dimensions:

Non-overt (zero) versus overt (bound-clitic-weak-pronoun)
Reduced (zero-bound-clitic-weak) versus non-reduced (pronoun)

Two 'harmony constraints' constrain pairings of form and content (these are in principle violable constraints)

  a) pronominals are reduced iff they are specialized for topic anaphoricity
  b) pronominals are inherently specified for person/number/gender iff they are overt.

A set of markedness constraints (no fixed ranking) assesses marks against reduced pronominals:

  *‚àö‚àè[PRO]   *af [PRO]   *CL [PRO]  *Weak [PRO]

The first two are 'iconicity' constraints; the second two are 'avoid allotaxy' constraints. Because no markedness constraint penalizes the free form, this form will emerge as 'unmarked' in contexts where the others are penalized.

Haiman notes that pronominal forms in pidgins are FREE forms, and thus do not violate any of these constraints. 

The other relevant constraints are faithfulness constraints, which enforce faithfulness to input. Important would be faithfulness to TOP, which would be violated in a language without reduced pronominal forms, or faithfulness to AGR (?) which would be violated in a language with only zero pronominals.

A ranking like this: MARKEDNESS >> FAITHFULNESS would have only free pronouns. 
Demotion of the individual markedness constraints will admit various kinds of reduced pronouns. 
However even in languages with reduced pronouns, if there are contexts in which those reduced pronouns are excluded, then the free forms will fill the paradigmatic gaps. Several examples are given:

In Chichewa, the bound form of the pronoun is not possible with certain prepositions. IN this case, the free form is used, even though it violates faithfulness to TOP. In {Japanese}, the zero form is impossible with a preposition. In this case again, the free form is used, even though it violates faithfulness to TOP. Bresnan also shows that the zero form can emerge even in a language where the bound form is usually used rather than zero, in contexts where the bound form is excluded (Walpiri). 

Finally, she discusses the claim that all languages have free pronouns, arguing that if one accepts the functional definition of pronoun, then elements whose formal properties are different from those of canonical pronouns can be seen as the free forms, e.g. demonstratives, pronouns which are aligned with an edge, nominal-derived pronouns, etc.},

In particular, Chomsky's elimination of AGR from the inventory of admissible functional heads leads to a re-discussion of most generative analyses on Ergativity, which were crucially based on the role played by AGR-heads. In this work I will show that the two Case systems can merely be seen as the outcome of a principle of Economy which establishes that only one Case in a transitive sentence needs to be marked. In other words, the crucial point is not which Case is checked in an unaccusative clause, as traditionally assumed, but rather which of the two Cases is marked in a transitive clause. To test the validity of my proposal, I will discuss most of the phenomena commonly linked with Ergativity, while bringing together data from a wide inventory of different languages.},

   Volume = {3},
   Pages = {13--21},
   Note = {"So far we have simply noted that some lgs have the phenomenon of definite direct object marking, and some have the phenomenon of animate direct object marking. However, the interesting feature is that in many, if not most, of these languages there is no absolutely rigid distinction between definite direct object marking and animate direct object marking. In some languages, the 'seepage' ...is slight. ..In many languages, the 'seepage' is ... even greater." [14--15]

Argues that one cannot account for Hindi marking by reference just to animacy or just to definiteness. Both are relevant. [17] Discusses also Tagalog and Mongolian.

"The data presented above...serve to show that definite and animate direct objects often function together for the purposes of case marking, i.e. form a natural class (or at least form a natural class for the purpose of the rule of case marking)." WHY? " "certain grammatical relations tend to be characterized by certain features" (cites Givón and Keenan in Li Subject and Topic volume). Proposes that "the essential function of case marking ... is not so much to have an overt marking of subjects...and objects, but rather to have an overt marking of the difference between subjects and direct object" "Since subjects are typically animate and definite, one kind of direct object that is particularly likely to get a special marker will be animate and/or definite direct objects. Thus the feature that animate and definite direct objects have in common...is that both are kinds of direct object that are particularly likely to be confused with subjects unless they are so marked." [19]

Argues AGAINST subsuming case marking and agreement of definite/animate direct objects because the functions of case marking and agreement are different (case marking's function is to discriminate subject and direct object; claims that the function of verb agreement 'serves to unite definite/animate direct objects and subjects' [20].)

As part of this discussion:

Notes that there is some evidence that languages also tend sometimes to have special markers for subjects which are particularly likely to be confused with direct object (Comrie 1975, forthcoming). But not aware of any special VERB agreement with indefinite subjects, although this would be predicted if verb agreement and case marking functioned exactly in parallel. 

This should be linked to fact that agreement develops from pronominal markers?},

Larger issue here is the relation between abstract CASE and agreement. Clearly (?) there is no clear structural relation between grammatical function and agreement.},
   Abstract = {"The purpose of this paper is not to discuss directly the question of whether the active/passive voice opposition was a factor in the development of verb forms in Algonquian languages, but rather to examine the more fundamental question of whether agreement systems sensitive primarily to animacy necessarily involve a voice opposition. " p229. Through an examination of data from Chukchee and Tangut, concludes that "voice is a possible, but not means necessary, way by which an agreement system of this kind can arise. 
"In conclusions, we have demonstrated two ways in which languages can manifest the general principle 'agree with the noun phrase argument of highest animacy'. One possibility is for voice changes to operate so that the noun phrase with the highest animacy is moved to that grammatical relation with which agreement would normally be expected...this is seen in Chukchee. The other possibility is for agreement to be directly with the noun of highest animacy, quite irrespective of grammatical relations, and this possibility is seen in Tangut" [234] (also in {T}z'utujil, {K}'ichee')},

The idea is that when the discourse configurational constraints are irrelevant, the unmarked order surfaces -- this is found in cases of sentence focus.

   Note = {"our claim is that these LF conditions conspire to redistribute {NP} arguments in a hierarchy according to their definiteness"

German: quantificational object has its scope fixed at s-structure

German: definite objects and definite pronouns are degraded if they remain within the VP. <= basis for argument that variable not existentially bound must move out of {VP} by S-structure, which fixes the scope of existential closure.

Egyptian Arabic: question they address is: why are there no free-standing object pronouns. Answer: they move (by head-movement) with V out of {VP} to escape existential closure. What about definite NPs, which do not move? Their answer is that there is no place for object NPs to move to because subject NPs occupy all available specifier positions. (Why about adjoining to VP?)

They note [p. 132] that EA excludes existential indefinites from [Spec, IP], this identified with the preverbal position; cf. also {S}panish!

Analogue with object shift in Scandinavian/Germanic:
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢Icelandic optionally permits full NPs to shift, requires pronouns to shift;
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢Mainland Scandinavian permits only pronouns to shift; Danish requires them to shift; in Sweden the shifting is optional; Soln: "Somehow there is no specifier position available" [167]

Object shift linked to movement of V; movement possibilities differ in the two types of languages:
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢Icelandic shows V to I and V to I to C; (V movement both in main clauses and in embedded clauses)
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢Mainland Scandinavian permits only V to I to C (i.e. V-movement only in main clauses)

In Icelandic, shifted NPs must be definite or specific. Shifting an existential indefinite like a bare plural is not possible.

The generalization they extract: only presuppositional NPs can shift in Icelandic; in Mainland Scandinavian, ony a subset of presuppositional NPs, namely the NPs, can shift.

They extend this to the interaction between particle shift and definite pronouns in {English}, arguing that the obligatory shift of pronouns again moves them out of the scope of existential closure. The shift seen with full NPs, however, is to a VP-internal specifier position (per their analysis), since there is no specificity constraint associated with shifted NPs.

Cases which do not shift are: conjoined pronouns; stressed pronouns. 

Their account, for both the Egyptian and the Germanic cases, is that pronouns which are heads can move by head movement. They note (fn. 22) that in Germanic, this means 'excorporation' must be possible. 

In {English}, they claim, V moves to the head of AspPhrase, and generally, no further. In Germanic as a whole, there are 3 heads for possible V movement: Asp, T, and C.  "In both cases [i.e. two movements in Icelandic, JA], the verb must pass through T, and this verb movement triggers pronoun shift. The movement of the verb enables the object pronouns to move, and the unselectivity of existential closure forces them to move." [166] They claim that stressed pronouns are deictic or contrastive and in that sense function as 'new'information. Thus they can remain in {VP} without violating the Novelty Condition.},

   Note = {p. 209, fn 26: "pe is fully grammatical only with human referents, marginal with nonhuman animates" 

Her examples, p. 210, fn. 27, show that pe is optional with definites 

(iv) Ion l-a examinat pe vecin.
       John him-has examined pe neighbour.
(v) Ion a examinat vecinul.
      John has examined the neighbour"

(a clitic double seems to be required exactly when pe is used, though there are places where they do not cooccur). 

pe is required with human-referring pronouns, including "nobody", "somebody", "who" (but she shows that this is not quite right, see p. 257)

With respect to specificity: it is optional with "strong" indefinites, and impossible with "weak indefinites". 

Relation between clitics and pe: "These examples, characterized by the presence of a QNP preceded by pe...are marginal for most speakers: in contemporary Romanian prepositional accusatives are necessarily clitic-doubled, whenever possible. At the beginning of the century, these examples not only were correct but in fact constituted the unmarked possibility....Of interest here is the fact that the only possible interpretatin of these examples was (and still is, for those speakers who accept (61a,c), the specific one. The selection of this interpretation obviously depends on the presence of the preposition pe: if pe is absent, the nonspecific reading is also possible, along with the specific one. 

See xerox for examples.

   Pages = {1--25},
   Abstract = {Acehnese, an Austronesian language of north Sumatra, is of the `active', or so-called `Split-S' (Dixon (1979)) type: some intransitive verbs take arguments which have the distinguishing properties of `transitive subjects', and others take arguments with the properties of `transitive objects'. This distinction can be motivated for Acehnese on syntactic, semantic and discourse grounds, with the main focus of this paper on the motivation from discourse, in which special attention is paid to Du Bois' (1985, 1987a,b) treatment of the discourse motivation for ergativity. The two principal conclusions to be drawn from the Acehnese data are that: (i) there is no language internal basis for identifying an intransitive subject category; and, more importantly, (ii) the redundancy, or parallelism in patterning between semantics, syntax and discourse in Acehnese is unlikely to be accounted for by an approach which treats any one of these three domains as prior: instead a model of language is suggested in which the interaction of these separate domains, not their independent structures, is the ultimate object of linguistic description.

"The accusative suffix -wV [(schwa)], not surprisingly, appears on direct objects as well as subjects, as in (1a and b) above. In all positions, it is restricted to animate nouns or animate pronouns,[FN] and the extent to which it is employed differs with dialect. There are some dialects that employ it rarely if at all, and others use it with pronouns but rarely if at all with full nouns. This paper represents the 'wV-full' dialect..."
FN: The qualification 'animate' is repeated for pronouns here to avoid misunderstanding by those familiar with other South Asian languages. It is not the case in Sinhala that the accusative marker appears normally on animate nouns and all pronouns, animate or inanimate, in direct object position, as is the case, for example, with Hindi ko (seting aside the conditions of specificity that apply to the latter).

   Journal = {Australian Journal of Linguistics},
   Volume = {2},
   Pages = {167--196},
   Note = {This is a VERY useful discussion of some fundamental issues in case.

"In terms of the analysis proposed in this paper, so-called 'split case marking' decomposes into two distinct, but functionally related, phenomena, namely, non-homogeneous accusative marking and non-homogeneous ergative marking" [184]

Note: Goddard's use of the term "non-homogeneous" case marking, where I've used "discriminate" case marking.

Discusses the debate about how Silverstein's generalization is to be explained. According to one view (Dixon 1979, Comrie 1979 (Chukchee paper), Anderson (in the Shopen volume), the Silverstein hierarchy represents a scale of 'potential agency'. Another view (Wierzbika 1981), what is involved is a scale of 'topic-worthiness'. Mallinson and Blake 1981 also take this view. In this view, 'the ergative is not the prime topic position' [Mallinson and Blake 1979:120] He notes that Mallinson and Blake seem to take the patient as the "normal filler of the topic position" in an ergative language. He tries to put the 'patient orientation' of {D}yirbal into perspective "All these putative diagnostics of patient-orientation fail to apply to the vast majority of Australian languages". 

Goddard identifies the DIACRITICAL use (or discriminatory use) of case , which 'holds that the primary function of case marking (of core arguments in a transitive sentence) is simply to distingjish which {NP} is the A or agent, and which the O of patient" p189]

In contrast is the SUBSTANTIVE view of case marking, held by Wierzbicka and independently proposed by Hopper and Thompson. "This is that a case category has a positive semantic content, or meaning, in addition to its possible diacritic role. " Hopper and Thompson refer to this as an INDEXING function -- which "serves to indicate that a certain {NP} is 'an O', and which only incidentally serves to contrast that O with another {NP} which is a subject or has some other {NP} role." [H and T 1980:291]

Goddard stresses that the human/non-human distinction is significant outside of case (in the broad sense) and outside of Australia (and thus independent of ergativity), but this fails to take into account the fact that there is special ACCUSATIVE marking for humans, not NOMINATIVE, etc.},

They conclude that both constructions are constrained by the 'poset' relation (partially ordered set relation) -- a relation between the preclausal {NP} and some previously evoked entity in the discourse model... (This is responsible for the contrastive element in both constructions). Contra Prince, they argue that LD has a topic promotion function that is lacking in topicalization. (This accounts for why an anaphoric element like 'that' can be topicalized, but not LD'd.) The methodology here involves computing an 'anaphoricity' index for dislocatee (its relation to previous discourse) and computing its perseverance in later discourse (a la Givon). Topic promotion associated with low anaphoricity and high perseverance. They do not discuss Prince's other claim which involves a kind of pairing of contrast in Topicalization: since the predicate is an open sentence in which the topicalized constituent is an argument, there is another point of contrast, denoted by the stressed constituent in the predicate. The result is two dimensions of contrast. They have a useful comparison of Gundel's Givenness Scale (which relates linguistic form to cognitive status) and Prince's Familiarity Scale, which involves notions like "textually evoked", "situationally evoked" (which are neutralized to "activated" in Gundel), and inferred (via relation to previuos discourse, via {NP} internal form (which neutralize to "uniquely identifiable" in Gundel).},

Wh-movement and restrictions on pied-piping are argued to follow from the interaction of the theory of phases and a violable constraint that forces wh-feature checking under Agree to be as local as possible. The theory derives three observations that are attested in different languages: Pied-piping is recursive, the wh-phrase seeks to be at the edge of the pied-piped phrase, and pied-piping is a last resort.},

The purpose is to better understand discourse constraints on the form of referring expression. After an introduction to the theory, it is shown that backward-looking centers are very often encoded by zero pronouns, and that center shifts more often use full pronouns and full noun phrases than do center continuations and retains. Full noun phrase continues correlate with discourse segment openings, and ful pronoun continues correlate with dis ourse segment closings and with transitions from full noun-phrase to zero pronoun references.},

" "In a system where TRANSITIVE is a strong feature that is overt in the syntax, marked in an affix or "light verb" that is distinct from the lexical head of the cluase, it is possible for lexical items other than verbs to head finite sentences. ..Jelinek (1995a) argues that in Salish, where VOICE and TRANSITIVE are also overt projections, any openclass lexical item may head a finite clause" (202) 
Concerned also with thematic restrictions associated with particular argument positions (.e.g. implicit agents must be human in Yaqui; experiences cannot be direct objects in {Navajo}, etc; in Yaqui double accusative structures, the goal must be animate and affected; not the case with the ACC-DAT structures.},

Surveys 5 languages and the way dative is realized in them. In the PA languages, there is no dative movement, bec. alternative realizations in dative clauses is fixed by argument type of goal and patient. Only in non PA languages like Yaqui and {English} is dative movement possible. "Higher-ranked goal arguments have structural case; and lower-ranked goals hae an inherent oblique case. Dative movement is excluded, because arguments that differ in rank also differ in structural position, and thus differ in their Case options. I argue that these hierarchies provide important evidence on the question  of Argument Type as a parametric feature, evidene that in Pronominal Argument langauges, pronouns have one set of structural positions and Case options, while nominals have another set."},

(she notes that these splits -- which are governed by the same underlying principles -- distinct historical sources. "The animacy/referentiality splits arise from different sources. Thus, "peter his house" - constructions seem to start with highly salient and topical human possessors, the restrictions on preposed possessive forms in German and Slavic result from the "shrinking" of an older construction." (p. 5) 
   alienability split
The domain of anchoring relations 
   e.g. from {english} with animate 's possessors:
        legal ownership
        kin relations
        body-part
         disposal (Peter's office)
        authorship (Peter's poem)
        carrier of properties    (Peter's braveness)
        social relations (Peter's neighbour)
inanimate "possessors"
        temporal relations (Monday's performance)
        locative relations (Stockholm's banks)

"The comon semantic (or pragmatic) denominator in the majority of PNPs is the function of the possessors as anchors (Hawkins 1978, 1991; Fraurud 1990), or reference point entities (OLangacker, e.g. 1991: 170, 1995; Taylor 1886: 17) for identification of the head's referents: "in opting to use a possessive expression, the speaker is instructing the hearer on how best to identify the referent that he, the speaker, intends" (Taylor ibid).

The domain of non-anchoring relations (when possessive construction is used to characterize the head, rather than to anchor it, "a ring of gold", "bread knife" (why call this possessive at all?)},

   @Abstract = {This paper discusses a Case paradigm that differs from standard Ergative systems in that Unergative predicates (Perlmutter 1978) assign Ergative Case, which only surfaces in transitive predicates in standard Ergative systems. The Case system under discussion is shown to be Ergative in the sense of Bobaljik (1992) and Chomsky (1992). The discrepancy is due to an independent parameter: the internal argument of the unergative predicates (Hale and Keyser 1991), does not undergo Incorporation. The idiosyncratic properties of these arguments are discussed next. It is argued that they are NPs. It is then claimed that DP constituents must move out of {VP} to [Spec, Agr] where they check D features. NPs must remain inside {VP} and receive Case without involvement of Agr. A modification of Bobaljik's (1992) Obligatory Case Parameter and Chomsky's (1992) Case Theory, is presented where it is the activation of Case features which underlies the Parameter in Case Theory. Either C-T or C-V are activated. Structural Accusative Case and Inherent Partitive case (Belletti 1988) are argued to be two instantiations of the V Case feature (C-V). Structural Case is [C-V, Agr) as in Chomsky (1992)., Inherent Partitive Case is bare C-V. DPs must receive Structural Case; NPs must receive Inherent Case. NPs bearing C-V display Specificity effects (Enc 1991, Mahajan 1992). It is argued however that Specificity is not the feature determining syntactic placement. Rather, it is a syntactic-morphological requirement that determines which arguments remain VP-internal: DPs must be {VP} external and NPs cannot sit in Spec, Agr. The Case Theory proposed derives Burzio's Generalization, and shows it to be a generalization about the Nominative parameter, not about ergative grammars (as suggested by Levin 1983 for Basque).},

   @Note = {This article is supposed to be about the level at which the binding conditions apply. There is some discussion of several arguments that they apply at s-structure (Chomsky, Barss), based on LF Abar movement.  Then there is discussion of whether LF-A Movement has any effect on binding possibilities, and his conclusion is that it does not. LF Expletive replacement (Chomsky 1986) does not have any, so if it exists, binding conditions must be stated before it applies. Such replacement was later abandoned (1991 - adjunction to the expletive; 1995 - raising of just the formal features, leaving referential properties relevant to binding in a low position).  He then discusses cases of ECM subjects and shows that these can license elements in the main clause:

20 The DA proved [two men to have been at the scene] during e.o's trials.
22 The DA proved [no suspect to be at the scene of the crime] during his trial.
24 The DA proved noone to be at the scene during any of the trials.

Lasnik argues for OVERT raising of the subject into the main clause on the grounds that COVERT raising (as of formal features in there constructions) does not have these licensing properties. 

21. *The DA proved [there to have been two men at the scene] during each other's trials.
23. *The DA proved [there to be no suspect at the scene of the crime] during his trial.
25. *The DA proved [there to be noone at the scene] during any of the trials.

Consistent with the MP, Lasnik concludes that the licensing is at LF, but there is no covert movement, so that it is as though the licensing were sensitive to s-structure configuration.},

Analyzes the SVC in Yoruba as a "complex predicate phrase consisting of a main verb, followed by an adjunct phrase, or series of adjunct phrases". The argument is that extraction of an adjunct that appears to modify the serial verb is impossible (while extraction of an argument of the serial verb is possible). So the appropriate answer to a question like "How did hunger kill the man?" (lit: "how did hunger strike the man die?" must be something like "He didn't have money to buy food", not "He died at home". Or "How did he buy bread to eat?" (Lit: How did he buy bread ate?)  must be something like "He bought it on credit", not "He ate is sitting/quickly". The author concludes that the SVC is a {VP} adjoined to the main VP, and that it is a barrier to extraction. Author is committed to a single "S" structure. He is not explicit but it appears that the serial verb assigns its semantic role to a {NP} in the main clause and does not have  structural argument of its own.},

   School = {MIT},
   Type = {Ph{D} dissertation},
   Abstract = {This thesis argues for a reformulation of the A/A-bar distinction in the theory of syntax. In the first part of this thesis, it is shown that this reformulation is forced by both theoretical considerations raised by {VP} internal subject theories and also certain empirical considerations relating to scrambling operations in Hindi. Evidence for the reformulation includes locality constraints on movement, weak crossover phenomena, reconstruction effects and binding properties associated with movement. This evidence also leads to a new approach to the study of scrambling phenomena. It is suggested that scrambling  operations that move NPs may belong to two different kinds of syntactic operations--an operation that
 involves substituting the scrambled element into a SPEC of a functional projection internal to IP (with properties similar to a rule like Passive) and an operation that adjoins the scrambled {NP} to a maximal  projection (with properties similar to a rule like QR). The approach developed here yields a framework that  seems to be promising for the study of variation found with respect to scrambling phenomena in natural languages. The second part of this thesis argues that a language that does not have overt wh-movement at s-structure may not have wh-movement to SPEC CP at LF either. It is argued that in a language like Hindi, the wh-phrases simply undergo QR at LF. This operation adjoins a wh-phrase to the nearest IP. We show that this approach yields a number of consequences that are desirable in Hindi, a language that at first glance seems to be mixed between a language with overt wh-movement in syntax as well as wh-in-situ. We discuss some aspects of wide scope quantification in Hindi and some other languages and show that the absence of wh-movement to SPEC CP at LF yields certain effects that would be surprising under the approaches that permit wh-movement to SPEC CP at LF.

Actually, he argues that there are three positions for Case assignment to objects. In addition to these two, an object can move to a specifier below the Agr projection and be case marked under government. These are the cases, he proposes, where there is no overt object agreement, as in {English}. 

Paper relates the "specificity effect" (difficulty of extraction from indefinite,
NP (he calls them non-specifics)) to the Case proposal. Idea is that if only specific nominals move to some Specifier position to get Case, then these are predicted to be islands in languages where "subjects" are islands. Notes that in Hindi, neither subjects nor specific NPs are islands.},

Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are generated inside {NP} and function like noun modifiers. They are similar in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in {English}. Hindi left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to IP at D-structure. They do not function like noun modifiers but are quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope domain. It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong typologically with free relatives in {English} and internally-headed relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in common with these constructions.},

%   Note = {argues that Abar chains can terminate in resumptive pronouns in Irish; that they are found by an empty operator in [Spec, C] which may in turn be syntactically connected (through predication) to another element, e.g. a head noun. 
%Resumptive pronouns alternate with trace in Irish except in two contexts. Where constraints on traces or movement rule out traces, resumptives can occur but not traces (e.g. object of preposition). It is not clear to me what the status of binding a resumptive across a barrier is; in his book, McCloskey marks these ? or ??. And there is one place a trace can occur but a resumptive cannot. That is when the subject of the highest clause is Abar bound. McC argues this is because the resumptive is pronominal, hence subject to a version of Principle B which requires that a resumptive be Abar free in the minimal domain containing the resumptive and a subject. 
%McC further argues that resumptives are variables and as such are subject to strong crossover/Condition C, that is, they must be locally Abar bound: no binder in an A position is possible. He shows this by showing that an epithet cannot Abind a resumptive which is trying to be Abar bound by an operator. 
%Also of interest is the fact that complementizers have three forms in Irish: the form used with complement clauses; the form used when a trace is Abar bound, and the form used when a pronoun is Abar bound. He accounts for the trace form through Spec-head agreement of C with the trace in Spec, C. He accounts for the resumptive form by assuming that the chain formed between the operator and the resumptive can have Op links in the Spec, C positions, and that these trigger agreement. A puzzle is why if the lowest C agrees, all others must agree. McC argues that these are empty elements which must be antecedent-governed.},

Experiment 1 showed that animates tended to appear as subjects in active/passive sentences. The tendency in recall to shift from one voice to another increased if the result would place the animate in subject position. Similar shifts were not characteristic of order in coordinate structures positioned within sentences, though there were characteristic of coordinate structures presented 
ously. 

The tendency for animates to precede inanimates was shown to be a consequence of the preference for animates to be mapped onto subject role + the fact that in {English}, the subject is initial. "The relationship between animacy and subjecthood is standardly explained in terms of the link between particular thematic roles (often agency) and the subject function. IN lingusitics, the link is sometimes formulated as a mapping fom more primitive semantic relations such as agency of causation or motion...These accounts help to explain why certain types of noun phrases (technically, arguments) must play certain grammatical roles with respect to certain verbs. However, the accounts generally focus more on what is possible than on what is probable, with the consequence that they may fail to offer an explanation of broad but noncategorical tendencies. One of these broad tendencies is the affinity of animates for subjecthoo. This affinity appears in passive as well as in active sentences, and for passives it is hard to give a uniform explanation in terms of thematic role. For exaple, Pinker 1989, following Zubizaretta, 1987) offered an anlysis which removes the thematic role of agent from candidacy for subjecthood in passives, but it is unclear why the demotion of the agent is most likely to accompany the presence of an animate patient or theme. [p. 192]

Apparently, animates take the role of subject because of the large number of verbs in {English} that require or permit animate subjects (Jarvella and Sinott, 1972), and it happens that {English} sentence structure typically positios subjects in first position. The location of animate nouns in sentences, then, appears to be largely a byproduct of their grammatical role assignments.  [p. 220]

When grammatical structure is absent, however, we see forces at work which may have molded the cross-linguistic tendency for subjects themselves to lead (Clark and Clark, 1978): Words that denote animates have priority in production over words that denote inanimates. [p. 221]

In comprehension:

There was a consistent preference for sentences and phrases with animate leaders, suggesting that this order may be nmore natural for comprehension. The first referring expression in a sentence seems to have a privileged role in language comprehension [refs] with more prominence in memory than later expressions. Since animate nouns should generally be easier to integrate with subsequent material than inanimates because of their predicability, comprehension may flow more smoothly when animates lead. [p. 221]},
   Abstract = {Animacy, word length, and prosody have all been accorded prominent roles in explanations for word order variations in language use. We examined the sequencing effects of these factors in two types of tasks. In recall rasks designed to simulate language production, we found selective effects of animacy. Animate nouns tended to appear as subjects in transitive sentences [transitive here seems to include active and passive sentences, JA], but showed no special affinity for initial position in conjunctions within sentences, suggesting a stronger involvement of animacy in grammatical role assignment than in word ordering. Word length had no significant impact: Shorter words did not appear earlier than longer words within sentences or within isolated conjunctions of nouns. Prosody had a weak effect on word order in isolated conjunctions, favoring sequences with alternating rhythm, but only in the absence of an animacy contrast. These results tend to confirm a hypothesized role for conceptual (meaning-based) accessibility ihn grammatical role assignment and to disconfirm a hypothesized role for lexical form-based) accessibility in word ordering. In a judgment task, forms with animate nouns early were preferred across all constructions, and forms with short words early were often preferred both in setneces and in conjunctions. The findings suggest a possible asymmetry between comprehension and production in functional accounts of word order variations.},

The problem of optionality in OT (and in Minimalism, where all movement is obligatory and feature driven).

Examples of optionality in syntax: optional presence of thatin {English}; optional WH movement in {French}; optional scrambling in German; RC extraposition in {English}; dative shift in {English}; partial/full WH movement in German

Approaches to optionality in OT:

1. Pseudo-optionality: the two outputs are members of different candidate sets, hence do not compete. Two problems: first, what defines candidate sets so that the two outputs belong to different sets? Same LF is not strong enough to assign the two outputs to different candidate sets; same numeration is not always strong enough; some discourse or functional related prominence might work but he puts aside factors which do not affect truth conditions.

2. True optionality: two outputs emerge from a single evaluation because they have exactly the same constraint profile. This avoids the problems above, but it requires that there be no constraint on which the two candidates differ. This is unlikely.

3. Ties. 
    Global ties: abbreviations for multiple constraint rankings co-existing in a single lg. discussed in Prince and Smolensky; the ranking for the two is in a sense underspecified. A candidate is grammatical iff it is optimal under at least one total order that is generated by resolving all ties that exist in the language. This approach allows a  candidate which violates a low-ranking constraint which its competitor satisfies to win -- because there is some total ranking on which it is the winning candidate. 

Problem here is conceptual complexity: grammar proliferation. How many coexisting grammars characterize a language? it would be quite a few with several ties involving multiple constraints. 

    Local ties: special constraint types. Avoids grammar proliferation. The output of a set of tied constraints is the union of the outputs of every possible ranking of those constraints. (Pesetsky)

Second,  under some conditions, both outputs are NOT possible because one violates some constraint. But if they belong to different candidate sets, what winner does the losing candidate lose to? (e.g. presence vs. absence of thatin {English}).

Conjunctive tie: tied constraints interpreted as conjoined, with violations cumulative.  A candidate violates a constraint if it violates one of the conjoined constraints, and violations are cumulative.

Disjunctive: A candidate satisfies the constraint if it satisfies one of the tied constraints. Can be interpreted both locally and globally.},

Nichols' general arg here is that surface structure reflects logical form more transparently in Zuni than in many other lgs. There is oblig WH movement, despite the fact that the lg is SOV, including multiple WH movement, and note also that the WH words and indefinites are morphologically linked == and that the indefinites move too (as in {T}zotzil).},

   Title = {Real World not Welcome Here: The Structure of the Jingulu Verb and its Implications for a Typology of (Non)Configurationality},
   Abstract = {Jingulu, a non-Pama-Nyungan language of North-Central Australia, displays regressive vowel height harmony (suffixes trigger harmony in roots) in both nominal and verbal words. Suffixes triggering harmony must not only contain a high vowel and be adjacent to the root, but must also belong to a narrow morphosyntactically defined class. 

I argue that harmony is the result of category-less roots merging with adjacent syntactic heads. Jingulu strictly distinguishes syntactic positions which can host encyclopedic ('real-world' semantic) features from those which can host only formal features. This distinction accounts for a range of morphosyntactic and phonological phenomena in Jingulu, including harmony. 

I then turn to an examination of nonconfigurationality in Austrialian languages, and show that there is a wider variety of nonconfigurational types than has been assumed in most formal analyses. I argue that Mark Baker's analyses of nonconfigurationality correctly characterize the means by which different languages establish relationships between overt elements, but fail to capture the essential source of nonconfigurational behavior. This source, I propose, is a restriction on what positions in the clause are able to host encyclopedic information. It is restrictions against encyclopedic information in certain positions that drive a language to exhibit various kinds of 'nonconfigurational' behavior. This analysis extends to a wide variety of languages and language types (configurational and nonconfigurational), including the problematic Papuan language Kalam. 

Finally, I establish a continuum of (non)configurational types among some Australian languages, and speculate on how one extreme of nonconfigurationality (fully head-marking) might develop from another (fully dependent-marking), demonstrating that each stage in the hypothetical shift is represented by at least one modern Australian language.},

He argues that OT effects may be limited to that aspect of syntax which concern the interface with pronunciation, e.g. positions in which "moved" elements are pronounced, the principles which determine which element in the C projection is pronounced (e.g. relative pronoun, Comp, both, neither). He suggests that other interacts suggest that the OT model is inappropriate -- in particular what he terms "Clash and Crash" -- cases in which there is a set of principles which cannot all be satisfied simultaneously, and where the derivation crashes, rather than being expressed in the "optimal" way available.

On a technical note: he uses constraint "tie" to account for the realization of Spec, C and Comp in {English} relatives. His constraints are a) Left Edge (CP): the first (leftmost) pronounced word in CP must be the complementizer, and b) Telegraph: do not pronounce function words. The first favors presence of COMP, the latter penalizes it. He analyzes the fact that both options are possible in {English} as a consequence of the fact that it is "as if the ouput of Left Edge (CP) and Telegraph were the union of the outputs of the two possible rankings" (p. 161). [There are further interactions with another constraint, Recoverability, which concerns when the WH phrases can be elided.] He sees as a clear OT-type effect the distribution of WH and comp in {French}: the fact that under pied piping, WH cannot be deleted, but otherwise it must be, with COMP surfacing. The ranking is: RECOVERABILITY >> LEFT-EDGE (CP) >> TELEGRAPH.

There is also some discussion of island effects, and their amelioration through resumptive pronouns. He makes the argument that these effects are GRADIENT (pronouns improve the sentence but only partly) point away from OT, since an OT evaluation yields a winner and a set of losers, period.},

He emphasizes a) the fact that he uses "case" to refer to any formal device for distinguishing grammatical function, inc. word order, agreement, and dependent marking; b) the need to consider the hierarchy of referential features IN CONNECTION WITH the relational (or proto-role) hierarchy, and not in isolation (p. 236); c) the variety of phenomena which are sensitive to this alignment, mentioning Smith-Stark's work on plurality and Wierzbicka's mention of clitic order, agreement, verb inflection; d) the fact that the "cut-off" point in the referential hierarchy can be "AT ALMOST ANY FEATURE and not just those of speaker and addressee reference. So we suspect that there is some overall principle at work that is independent of speakerhood and addresseehood per se" [237]; discusses the fact that anaphoric pronouns frequently behave as though they occupied a position higher in the hierarchy than their corresponding non-pronominal counterparts. 

S grounds his account of the hierarchy in what he terms PREDICATION-PERSPECTIVE, i.e. "the perspective from which a state of affairs is predicated of referents, the most 'natural' being that which grows out of the configuration of the the ongoing speech event, the informational givens of which, the maximally presupposable entities, are of course of the same ordering as above. Hence, speaker (and/or addressee will most 'naturally' be the prior referent the privileged one, generally 'Agent-of' and 'Subject-of' in direct (as opposed to inverse) predicate schemata." [243] Note that this is not conceived in terms of 'potential agency'; it is more closely related to DeLancey's viewpoint, though here the notion of PREDICATION links it to grammatical function and subjecthood. It is not clear how to square this with languages like {T}zotzil, where effects are ONLY in the 3rd person. [This point should perhaps be emphasized in future work.]},

Namely: with DP dominating NP, {NP} is a blocking category and a barrier, and DP inherits barrierhood. Extraction in the (ii) involves crossing two barriers, while in (i), WH can stop off in [Spec, D], thus crossing only one barrier. 2) under the assumption that theta roles are assigned within the governing domain of the head, noun genitives assigned subject theta role must be originate within [Spec, N] and raise to [Spec, D] for case. 3) interaction with control theory, this explains why PRO is licensed within noun phrase (exx like: John needs a PRO good talking to, The government condems the PRO-arb destruction of private property PRO to make a political statement). Assuming that PRO must be ungoverned, it must be protected from government by V, and this is accomplished if it originates and remains within [Spec, N].

   Note = {The Aspectual Interface Hypothesis: The mapping between thematic structure and syntactic argument structure is governed by aspectual properties. ...Only the aspectual part of thematic structure is visible to the syntax. (p. 2). 

(1) The internal argument of a simple verb is constrained so that it either undergoes no change or motion, or it undergoes change or motion which 'measures out the event" over time. (p. 3)

The direct internal argument of a verb of change "measures out" over time the event described by the verb. The verb's direct internal argument may be thought of as being converted into a function of time at some level of semantic representation. This is an aspectual property, because aspects refers to the internal temporal organization of an event. ... The idea of an object measuring out an event can be elucidated using the aspectual property of delimitedness. A delimited event is one that the language encodes as having an endpoint in time. (p. 5)

She gives "push" as an example of a nondelimited verb (nb "push" can be used to denote change of location, but doesn't require it).

For some VPs which denote delimited events, the internal argument itself delimits the event [verbs of consumption, creation, destruction, performance?, change (perform a play, translate a poem, destroy the city, build the house, drink the wine, eat the chicken, redden the photograph, ripen the apple).

"Under the theory proposed here, all direct internal arguments undergoing change are constrained to measure out the event, whether or not it is a delimited event. .. "push the cart for an hour/*in an hour; push the cart to NY in an hour/?for an hour." Here the direct internal argument measures out the event, the indirect internal argument delimits it.

She observes that there is a class of verbs whichtranslate count-ness of the internal argument into delimitedness of the event ("drink"), but opines that there "is no corresponding class of verbs that translate count-ness of the external argument into delimitedness of the event" (p. 7)

   Note  = {this draft may never have been published. It argues in a rather entangled way for a conception of clause structure in which the object c-commands the subject. Evidence is the coreference blockage in sentences like "his/Peter's father loves him". There are various possible instantiations of this sentence, and he argues that some of them can be blocked via the binding theory, only if the object c-commands the subject. Other instantiations require language-particular assumptions about other pronominal elements.

He forwards another argument based on "Who did his father see?" in which coreference is again impossible. He argues that this is a case of Strong Crossover, i.e. a Condition C violation again. 

His argument that the subject does not c-command the object rests on Ss like [*xil naj smam naj] "he-i saw his-i father". His claim is that if the subject c-commands the object, and if the poss'r is an R-expression, the sentence will be excluded by Condition C, and then his pragmatic account will not kick in -- the prediction is that it should not be possible to salvage the sentence, but it is, by replacing naj with pro. Since the sentence can be salvaged, he concludes that the subject does not c-command the object. He assumes that there is no other account of why overt naj is ungrammatical. [But this is lack of imagination -- a rule deleting naj, a la Colette's original analysis, would account for this.] He goes on, but in a convoluted mode. He concludes with an interesting observation re [smam naj pel] xila  "it was Peter's father that he (= Peter) saw." Assuming reconstruction, this should yield a violation of condition C at LF. But there is no such violation. [Suppose though that the deletion of the subject},

   @Note = {In the MP, grammatical relations cannot be defined in terms of structural positions (as in earlier versions of the framework). (Note that McCloskey and Harley had already pointed out that GFs could not be associated with a fixed, unique structural position.) But they can be defined in terms of the "relation created by formal feature checking" [13]. With this framework, one can attribute the capacity to be involved in a particular grammatical phenomenon (e.g. agreement, control, floating Q) to a feature checking relation with a particular head. E.g., checking of ‚àö‚àè features with T is required for agreement, same relation (it is proposed) is req'd for control; checking EPP feature with T required to float quantifier. 

Formal features (following Chomsky 1995a). A formal feature is a) accessible in the course of C-HL, associated with a lexical item ("encoded in or assigned to"). There are three types of F which are important here: ‚àö‚àè features (person, gender, number), categorial features like D, Case features (the term 'nominal features' refers to all three). Fs undergo feature checking. This drives movement, under the LAST RESORT condition. Only like features check. The checkee must be in the 'checking domain' of the checked feature. 

Ura diverges in two respects from Chomsky 1995a:  i] Fs may be + multiple or -multiple. A +multiple F may or must be checked by multiple element. (This permits "double nominatives").  ii] F may tolerate one or more violations of Procrastinate. Some F may tolerate none, some may tolerate one, some may tolerate more than one. 
HU relies crucially on multiple feature checking, i.e.},

[+human] and/or [+specific and +singular]; 2) why are exactly the same features associated with inserted prepositions, but not base-generated prepositions; 3) why does object agreement only occur in the perfective aspect, while preposition insertion is limited to imperfectives. "basic idea ...is that economy principles keep objects in their base positions, unless that would violate exclusion principles. Exclusion principles are modified versions of the mapping principles of Diesing 1992 and Diesing and Jelinek 1993 which exclude NPs with certain features from object positions inside VP. ..NPs with the features referred to by either exclusion rule are forced out of the {VP} (in perfective claues), moving to Spec Agr-O where they trigger object agreement." [656]  Preposition insertion can also avoid violations of the exclusion principles. Reviews an approach to Case which she terms "features on Case", and associates with Helen de Hoop's work: the idea that particular Cases are associated with specific (universal) semantic features. A {NP} can carry a particular Case, only if it is associated with those features. She rejects this because: She adopts an approach which she regards as a version of Diesing's mapping hypothesis, but in fact entirely vitiates it, since it needs to "exclude from the VP' both specific objects AND human objects. The latter have nothing to do with the semantic conditions that exclude specific objects from VP. This account equates case marking with movement, so what competes are the Exclusion principles and "Avoid Movement". The latter keeps NPs which are not subject to the exclusion principles from being case marked. (It is parallel to *Struc in my account.) For double object constructions in the perfective, where only the primary object triggers agreement, she assumes 1) that double agreement is impossible, and that Case Filter rules out movement to any other position; and 2) that minimality rules out a derivation in which the 2nd object moves to ObjAgr.  How does preposition insertion obviate the exclusion principles? She assumes "that NPs inside PPs are exempt from the exclusion principles. That is, that the exclusion principles only refer to the features of objects governed by V." [682]. This is yet another deviation from Diesing's approach. The difference between perfective and imperfective patterns is accounted for by reranking of Avoid Insertion and Avoid Movement in the two aspects.},

   @Note = {Case not present in input, but added by GEN There is a set of universal, inviolable constraints on Case, from Case Theory including the requirement that every argument must have a licensed Case. There are two kinds of Case -- inherent and structural. Many arguments have a choice of multiple licensed Cases. Inherent case is enforced by faithfulness conditions (not to input, but to lexical Case requirements of verbs); Structural case is penalized by Markedness. Suggests that inherent case is always more marked than structural case; that there are no markedness relations among inherent Cases, but that there may be between structural Cases.  (Partial) She assumes (following Mahajan 1990 and Woolford 1997) that there are "two distinct structural object Cases, one licensed in a functional projection outside the {VP} and the other licensed by V, inside the VP. We will see in section five that both Cases occur in Nez Perce (Woolford 1997)." ms p. 5 She claims a systematic distinction between subjects and objects, where subjects generally have the same abstract Case, and discriminate marking is just a difference in the realization of Case, while discriminate marking on objects reflects different structural Cases. But is this well-motivated?? Cf. {S}panish, where objects, whether marked with "a" or not passivize, have pronominal forms with the same shape, trigger relativization in the same form. What about objects in {D}yirbal -- 3rd person (‚àö‚àè) and local person (accusative) -- do these conjoin or otherwise show same behavior? According to Dixon's ergativity book, objects (whether ‚àö‚àè or accusative) satisfy the pivot requirement in topic chains, i.e. would seem to have the same abstract absolutive Case (160ff). Her basic intuitive idea is that 'syntax 'wants' an empty {VP} (or at least one which is empty of structurally Cased arguments), just as phonology 'wants' an empty coda in syllables. Structurally  Cased VP-internal arguments are worse if they have marked features, just as codas are worse if they have marked features." [p. 36] "The strategies that languages use to avoid having a VP-internal structurally Cased argument are of two types: one is to make the argument not VP-internal, by moving it out of VP, while the other is to alter the Case of the argument, with the addition of a prepositin or an inherent Case. The reason that objects are so much more often affected by the markedness constraints that enforce this 'desire' for an empty {VP} is simply that subjects are often immune because they are generally outside of the {VP} for independent reasons" [p. 36] In other words, she does NOT see these constraints as involving 'markedness reversal'! She proposes that double case violations be handled by OCP[case]: 
OCP[case]: prohibits two (adjacent?) instances of the same Case in one clause. [ms. p. 9]},

It seems to me that his predicate composition analysis doesn't predict the agreement facts that we find. If the arguments are composed, first there is the question of what determines the fact that both the internal argument and the external argument can be shared. Is this simply stipulated in the form of distinct templates? But if we do compose the arguments, then the lowest will be realized as object, and the highest will be realized as subject, but how will we actually get the agreement right? Perhaps this could follow from the Semantic Form, which would represent the two predicates and their arguments separately. The position of ergative agreement, and the possibility of absolutive on the base verb -- these would have to follow from the semantic form and possibly they could, since the decomposed information would be present there.},

   Note = {Argues against bidirectional optimization in the syntax. Rather argues for a normal unidirectional production oriented evaluation, followed by interpretive constraints. He identifies a short list of such constraints.Sketches solutions for some of the problems discussed in the lit using weak bidirectional optimization:

‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ 'kill'/'cause to die': instead of weak b.o., proposes that among the generation constraints are ECONOMY (which penalizes complex expression of a simple concept) and PARSE-MARKED (which requires complex expression for an input which is indicated as 'marked'). In this account, there are two distinct inputs, each of which is associated with two candidate forms. For the 'direct causation' input, 'cause to die' violates economy. For the indirect clausation input, 'kill' violates the faithfulness condition (Parse Marked). (Parse-marked has to be ordered above Economy) to get right results.) In this way, we get the result: use the simplest expression which yields the desired interpretation. In Blutner's system, there are also two constraints. The "F" constraint is like Economy. But the "C" constraint penalizes complex interpretations (in essence). So the more marked expression violates both F and C, but still emerges as a superoptimal pair. The association of 'cause to die' with indirect causation is not a consequence of faithfulness, per Zeevat, but a consequence of the mode of evaluation. Zeevat worries that in Blutner's system, hearer violates *INVENT (? in that they have to add to the content of the winner, i.e. have to add in to the expression 'cause to die' the indirect causation that it implies (?). He wants the inputs to contain a mark that distinguishes them. (But for Blutner, the 'input' for be his t1, t2 and these would be distinguished as less and more complex...)==> The difference is that Zeevat has a constraint (Parse-MARKED) which stipulates the connection between more marked content and more marked form, while Blutner does not. It is a consequence of the evaluation.},

Abstract This paper provides a formal theory of inflectional periphrasis, the phe- nomenon where a multi-word expression plays the grammatical role normally played by a single word filling a cell in an inflectional paradigm. Expanding on the literature, I first identify and illustrate six key properties that a satisfactory theory of periphrasis should account for: (i) the phenomenon of periphrasis is found in the inflection of all major parts of speech; (ii) the logic of the opposition between periphrasis and syn- thesis is the logic of inflection; (iii) auxiliaries as used in periphrases are morphosyn- tactic hybrids; (iv) some periphrases are morphosyntactically non-compositional; (v) periphrasis is independent of phrase structure, but (vi) the parts of a periphrase are linked by a grammatical function. The rest of the paper presents a lexicalist theory of periphrasis, relying on a version of HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) for syntax com- bined with a version of Paradigm Function Morphology (Stump 2001) for inflection. The leading idea is that periphrases are similar to syntactically flexible idioms; the theory of periphrasis is thus embedded within a more general theory of collocation. Periphrasis is accounted for in a strictly lexicalist fashion by recognizing that expo- nence may take the form of the addition of collocational requirements. I show how the theory accounts for all key properties identified in the first section, deploying partial analyses for periphrastic constructions in {English}, {French}, {Czech}, and Persian.

	Abstract = {Do the visuomanual modality and the structure of the sequence of numbers in sign language have an impact on the development of counting and its use by deaf children? The sequence of number signs in Belgian {French} Sign Language follows a base-5 rule while the number sequence in oral {French} follows a base-10 rule. The accuracy and use of sequence number string were investigated in hearing children varying in age from 3 years 4 months to 5 years 8 months and in deaf children varying in age from 4 years to 6 years 2 months. Three tasks were used: abstract counting, object counting, and creation of sets of a given cardinality. Deaf children exhibited age-related lags in their knowledge of the number sequence; they made different errors from those of hearing children, reflecting the rule-bound nature of sign language. Remarkably, their performance in object counting and creating sets of given cardinality was similar to that of hearing children who had a longer sequence number string, indicating a better use of counting than predicted by their knowledge of the linguistic sequence of numbers. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Young children typically take between 18 months and 2 years to learn the meanings of number words. In the present study, we investigated this developmental trajectory in bilingual preschoolers to examine the relative contributions of two factors in number word learning: (1) the construction of numerical concepts, and (2) the mapping of language specific words onto these concepts. We found that children learn the meanings of small number words (i.e., one, two, and three) independently in each language, indicating that observed delays in learning these words are attributable to difficulties in mapping words to concepts. In contrast, children generally learned to accurately count larger sets (i.e., five or greater) simultaneously in their two languages, suggesting that the difficulty in learning to count is not tied to a specific language. We also replicated previous studies that found that children learn the counting procedure before they learn its logic -- i.e., that for any natural number, n, the successor of n in the count list denotes the cardinality n + 1. Consistent with past studies, we found that children's knowledge of successors is first acquired incrementally. In bilinguals, we found that this knowledge exhibits item-specific transfer between languages, suggesting that the logic of the positive integers may not be stored in a language-specific format. We conclude that delays in learning the meanings of small number words are mainly due to language-specific processes of mapping words to concepts, whereas the logic and procedures of counting appear to be learned in a format that is independent of a particular language and thus transfers rapidly from one language to the other in development. },

	Abstract = {Connectionist and dynamical systems approaches explain human thought, language and behavior in terms of the emergent consequences of a large number of simple noncognitive processes. We view the entities that serve as the basis for structured probabilistic approaches as abstractions that are occasionally useful but often misleading: they have no real basis in the actual processes that give rise to linguistic and cognitive abilities or to the development of these abilities. Although structured probabilistic approaches can be useful in determining what would be optimal under certain assumptions, we propose that connectionist, dynamical systems, and related approaches, which focus on explaining the mechanisms that give rise to cognition, will be essential in achieving a full understanding of cognition and development. },

@article{Griffiths2010,
	Abstract = {Cognitive science aims to reverse-engineer the mind, and many of the engineering challenges the mind faces involve induction. The probabilistic approach to modeling cognition begins by identifying ideal solutions to these inductive problems. Mental processes are then modeled using algorithms for approximating these solutions, and neural processes are viewed as mechanisms for implementing these algorithms, with the result being a top-down analysis of cognition starting with the function of cognitive processes. Typical connectionist models, by contrast, follow a bottom-up approach, beginning with a characterization of neural mechanisms and exploring what macro-level functional phenomena might emerge. We argue that the top-down approach yields greater flexibility for exploring the representations and inductive biases that underlie human cognition. },

@article{Dawkins1973,
	Abstract = {Behaviour can be described in terms of its changing uncertainty or decision structure over time. Such a description is economical, maximally informative and may well be of importance neurophysiologically. We try to show that the methods which are normally used to detect temporal patterning between already recognized behavioural acts can also be used on a finer time scale to detect moment to moment patterns of posture within those acts. From such analyses, it is possible to calculate the 'decisioniness' or 'uncertainty' of different parts of the behavioural sequence. We illustrate this by an attempt to describe the decision structure of the drinking behaviour of domestic chicks, using frame by frame videotape analysis. For example, it appears that the first downstroke phase of each drink is more uncertain as to outcome than the other phases, suggesting that 'decisions' are taken during the downstroke. We end with an attempt to plot a continuous graph of behaviour uncertainty against time sampled at 50 msec intervals. /// Verhaltensabläufe können als Zeitfunktionen ihrer Ungewi{\ss}heit oder Entscheidungsstruktur betrachtet werden. Diese Art der Beschreibung ist ökonomisch, maximal informativ und wahrscheinlich auch neurophysiologisch von Bedeutung. Wir wollen zeigen, da{\ss} statistische Methoden, die normalerweise angewandt werden um die zeitliche Organisation von Verhaltensabläufen zu beschreiben, mit einer feineren Zeitskala auch dazu benutzt werden können, den Ablauf von Einzelhandlungen zu erkennen. Von solchen Analysen ausgehend kann man ein Entscheidungs- oder Ungewi{\ss}heitsma{\ss} für die verschiedenen Phasen einer Verhaltenssequenz berechnen. Als Beispiel versuchen wir, die Entscheidungsstruktur des Trinkververhaltens von Hühnerküken zu beschreiben unter Benutzung einer Einzelbildanalyse von Video-Magnetbandaufnahmen. Die erste Abwärtsbewegung eines jeden Trinkaktes scheint, bezüglich der ihr folgenden Bewegungen, ein grö{\ss}eres Ungewi{\ss}heitsma{\ss} zu besitzen als alle anderen Phasen des Trinkaktes. Dieses deutet an, da{\ss} Entscheidungen hauptsächlich während der Abwärtsphase getroffen werden. Zuletzt zeichneten wir versuchsweise eine kontinuierliche, zeitabhängige Verhaltensungewi{\ss}heitsfunktion dieses Trinkverhaltens mit einer 50 msec. Auflösung auf.},

@article{Fruchter2013,
	Abstract = {To what extent does morphological structure play a role in early processing of visually presented {English} past tense verbs? Previous masked priming studies have demonstrated effects of obligatory form-based decomposition for genuinely affixed words (teacher-TEACH) and pseudo-affixed words (corner-CORN), but not for orthographic controls (brothel-BROTH). Additionally, MEG single word reading studies have demonstrated that the transition probability from stem to affix (in genuinely affixed words) modulates an early evoked response known as the M170; parallel findings have been shown for the transition probability from stem to pseudo-affix (in pseudo-affixed words). Here, utilizing the M170 as a neural index of visual form-based morphological decomposition, we ask whether the M170 demonstrates masked morphological priming effects for irregular past tense verbs (following a previous study which obtained behavioral masked priming effects for irregulars). Dual mechanism theories of the {English} past tense predict a rule-based decomposition for regulars but not for irregulars, while certain single mechanism theories predict rule-based decomposition even for irregulars. MEG data was recorded for 16 subjects performing a visual masked priming lexical decision task. Using a functional region of interest (fROI) defined on the basis of repetition priming and regular morphological priming effects within the left fusiform and inferior temporal regions, we found that activity in this fROI was modulated by the masked priming manipulation for irregular verbs, during the time window of the M170. We also found effects of the scores generated by the learning model of Albright and Hayes (2003) on the degree of priming for irregular verbs. The results favor a single mechanism account of the {English} past tense, in which even irregulars are decomposed into stems and affixes prior to lexical access, as opposed to a dual mechanism model, in which irregulars are recognized as whole forms.},

	Abstract = {It is a venerable and commonplace ituition that syllables are "peaks of sonority." Previous work by Mermelstein suggests that this intuition is nearly true on the acoustic surface of speech, and that relatively crude algorithms based on amplitude variation can work fairly well at counting syllables and locating their approximate extent. We have devised a simple speaker-independent algorithm for detecting sonority peaks in continuuous speech, and tested it accuracy as a syllable finder on several paragraphs of casual reading by four speakers. Performance was encouraging: less than 10% misses, and less than 1% false triggers. The misses were about evenly divided among (1) vowel-vowel transition, where no sonority minimum is expected, (2) intervocatic sonorants with insufficient amplitude dip, and (3) devoiced or deleted schwa. Methds for dealing with these cases will be discussed.},
