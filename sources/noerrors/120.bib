@article{Schneider-Zioga:2007,
	abstract = {Anti-agreement is the phenomenon whereby the morphosyntactic form of subject/verb agreement is sensitive to whether or not an agreeing subject has been locally extracted. This paper argues that, together with an anti-locality constraint on movement (Grohmann, 2003) which prohibits overly local movement as elaborated in (i--v), the occurrence of a canonically left dislocated subject in anti-agreement languages accounts for all syntax peculiar to the phenomenon in the Bantu language of Kinande: (i) subjects can extract long-distance even across islands; (ii) subjects are locally unextractable if the canonical subject/verb agreement occurs; (iii) local subject extraction requires a change in subject/verb agreement morphology; (iv) objects cannot locally extract even if they appear to do so; and (v) objects can extract longdistance; however, they are sensitive to islands. Evidence comes from an analysis of the distribution of nominal expressions in the language as well as in-depth examination of two different wh-question formation strategies in the language. This study also reveals that the last resort strategy in a language is relativized to what is first resort: if resumption is first resort, movement is last resort, and vice versa.},

I propose a new view of the nature of heads and head movement  that reveals that head movement is totally compliant with the stan-  dardly suggested properties of grammar. To do so, I suggest that head  movement is not a single syntactic operation, but a combination of  two operations: a syntactic one (movement) and a morphological one  (m-merger). I then provide independent motivation for m-merger, ar-  guing that it can be attested in environments where no head movement  took place.In this article, I address the issue of head movement in current linguistic  theory.

The literature on wh-scope-marking constructions in other languages debates the relative merits of two types of analyses---the direct-dependency account, which posits covert movement of an embedded wh-phrase to replace a matrix expletive, and the indirect-dependency account, which treats the embedded question as the restriction of a matrix wh-phrase. I argue that an explanation of the Warlpiri data can only be achieved through a variant of the indirect-dependency approach.},

	abstract = {We propose that agreement displacement phenomena sensitive to person hierarchies arise from the mechanism of Agree operating on articulated phi-feature structures in a cyclic syntax. Cyclicity and locality derive a preference for agreement control by the internal argument. Articulation of the probe determines (a) when the agreement controller cyclically displaces to the external argument and (b) differences in crosslinguistic sensitivity to person hierarchies. The system characterizes two classes of derivations corresponding empirically to direct and inverse contexts, and predicts the existence and nature of repair strategies in the latter. The properties of agreement displacement thus reduce to properties of syntactic dependency formation by Agree.},
